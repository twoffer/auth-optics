## Task: Review the implementation of Shared Types Day 2: Configuration &amp; Security Types

### Requirements
- Review the functionality in GitHub PR #12 (git branch feature/shared-types-day-2-config-security) and evaluate whether it satisfies the following:
  * The design in @docs/specs/auth-optics-shared-types-specification.md
  * The specific implementation plan in @docs/implementation-plans/feature-implementer/shared-types-day-2-config-security.md
  * OAuth2/OIDC standards according to the reference specification documentation
  * Standards and best practices for TypeScript, React, Node.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and any other technologies used
- Always use the reference specification documents and the official OAuth2/OIDC RFCs/specs to determine what the expected behavior should be

### Context Loading (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md)
**Always Load:**
- Component specification: @docs/specs/auth-optics-shared-types-specification.md
- Detailed implementation plan: @docs/implementation-plans/feature-implementer/shared-types-day-2-config-security.md
- GitHub PR diff (if available): #12
- @docs/reference/security/security-best-current-practice.md (all parts)

**DO NOT Load:**
- Test reports
- Other components' reviews
- Entire @docs/reference/ directory at once

### Scope Guards (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md for details)
**DO:**
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Check OAuth2/OIDC RFC compliance
- Suggest improvements
- Flag deviations from specifications

**DO NOT:**
- Fix code directly (suggest fixes in review)
- Modify specifications (flag discrepancies)
- Approve/reject PRs (user decision)
- Implement suggestions (reviewer role only)

### Documentation Requirements
- Write the review results to @docs/reviews/review-shared-types-day-2.md
- Create the review results document according to the guidelines in @docs/reviews/README.md

### Verification Requirements
- The code in GitHub PR #12, if it included all suggested fixes and improvements, would meet or exceed OAuth2/OIDC, security, and coding standards

### Project Tracking Requirements (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md for ownership)

**Update @docs/context/current-phase.md:**

- [ ] Add any issues discovered during the review (PRIMARY OWNER for review issues)
- [ ] Categorize issues by priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Include file paths where issues were found
- [ ] Link to review document for details
