## Task: Test the implementation of "Shared Types Day 2: Configuration & Security Types (Config, Discovery, Security, Vulnerability)"

**Detailed Plan:** "@docs/implementation-plans/feature-implementer/shared-types-day-2-config-security.md"
**GitHub PR:** "#12"
**Git Branch:** "feature/shared-types-day-2-config-security"

### Requirements
- Validate the implementation in GitHub PR "#12" (branch "feature/shared-types-day-2-config-security") according to:
  * The Test Plan in the PR
  * The verification checklist in "@docs/implementation-plans/feature-implementer/shared-types-day-2-config-security.md"
  * Any other criteria relevant to these changes
- **Test Execution:** Run all relevant tests (both existing and newly written)
- **Test Code:** Write new automated test code when needed (see Test Scope Guidance below)
- Always use the reference specification documents and the official OAuth2/OIDC RFCs/specs to determine what the expected behavior should be

### Context Loading (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md)
**Always Load:**
- Detailed implementation plan: "@docs/implementation-plans/feature-implementer/shared-types-day-2-config-security.md"
- Component specification: "@docs/specs/auth-optics-shared-types-specification.md"
- GitHub PR diff (if available): "#12"

**DO NOT Load:**
- Implementation plans (only use verification checklists)
- Entire @docs/reference/ directory at once

### Test Scope Guidance

**When to Write New Test Code:**

You SHOULD write automated test code when the component includes:
- ✓ Business logic or algorithms (e.g., PKCE generation, token validation)
- ✓ Security-critical functionality (e.g., authentication, authorization, cryptography)
- ✓ External integrations (e.g., KeyCloak API calls, HTTP requests)
- ✓ Complex state management or data transformations
- ✓ API endpoints with request/response handling

**When Test Code is NOT Required:**

You may skip writing new test code for:
- Pure TypeScript type definitions (interfaces, types, enums)
- Configuration files without logic (JSON, YAML)
- Documentation-only changes (markdown files)
- Simple utility functions with obvious behavior

**Test Types to Consider:**

Choose the appropriate test type(s) based on what you're testing:
- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions/services in isolation
  - Example: Testing PKCE code_verifier generation function
  - Location: `packages/[component]/__tests__/unit/`
- **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between components
  - Example: Testing OAuth2Client service calling KeyCloak discovery endpoint
  - Location: `packages/[component]/__tests__/integration/`
- **End-to-End Tests:** Test complete user workflows across the system
  - Example: Full authorization code flow from frontend through backend to KeyCloak
  - Location: `packages/[component]/__tests__/e2e/`

**Test Framework Setup:**
- **Use vitest** for all automated testing (required)
- If vitest is not configured for the package, set it up:
  1. Add to `package.json`: `vitest`, `@vitest/ui`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`
  2. Create `vitest.config.ts` with TypeScript support
  3. Add test scripts: `"test": "vitest"`, `"test:coverage": "vitest --coverage"`
- Reference existing vitest configs in other packages for consistency

**Test Implementation Guidelines:**
- Follow existing testing patterns in the codebase
- Write tests using vitest (`describe`, `it`, `expect`) in TypeScript
- Write tests in the appropriate `__tests__/` directory for the component
- Ensure tests are deterministic and don't depend on external state
- Include both happy path and error case scenarios
- Mock external dependencies appropriately for unit tests

### Scope Guards (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md for details)
**DO:**
- Validate implementation against specification requirements
- Write test code for components with logic (per Test Scope Guidance above)
- Run all relevant tests (existing and newly written)
- Document test failures in pending-issues.md
- Verify security properties against the threat model

**DO NOT:**
- Fix implementation code (report issues only - fixes are handled by other agents)
- Modify production code (testing only)
- Change test requirements (follow the specification and verification checklist)

### Documentation Requirements
- Write test results to "@docs/test-reports/test-shared-types-day-2-config-security.md"
- Create the test results document according to the guidelines in @docs/test-reports/README.md

### Project Tracking Requirements (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md for ownership)

**Update @docs/context/pending-issues.md (if applicable):**
- [ ] Add any issues discovered during testing
- [ ] Categorize by priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Include file paths to failing test code if applicable
- [ ] Include line numbers of failing code if known

### Exit Criteria
- [ ] All test validations executed
      ✓ All verification checklist items tested
      ✓ Test code written (if applicable)
      ✓ All tests run successfully (or failures documented)
- [ ] Any issues documented
      ✓ Test failures added to pending-issues.md
      ✓ Issues categorized by priority
- [ ] All documents updated
      ✓ Test report exists at "@docs/test-reports/test-shared-types-day-2-config-security.md"
- [ ] All project tracking updated
      ✓ pending-issues.md updated (if failures)
- [ ] Ready for next phase
      ✓ Test report complete
      ✓ No critical test failures blocking merge
