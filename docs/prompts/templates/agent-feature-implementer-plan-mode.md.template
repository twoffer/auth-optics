## Task: Create a detailed implementation plan for {{component_name}}

### Requirements
- Create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for {{master_plan_sections}} of {{master_plan}} that includes the following:
  * Checklist of all the steps that you will take to achieve the goals set forth in {{master_plan}} for the particular sections identified
  * Verification checklist with accompanying scripts to confirm that you have followed the steps according to {{master_plan}}
- Do NOT start writing any code yet

### Context Loading (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md)
**Always Load:**
- Master implementation plan: {{master_plan}}
- Component specification: {{specification}}

{{#if requires_oauth_context}}
**OAuth2/OIDC Context:**
- START HERE: @docs/reference/00-NAVIGATION-START-HERE.md (master index)
- Use the navigation guide to find specific flow/token/security documents needed
- Consult master plan for which documents are most relevant

{{#endif requires_oauth_context}}
**DO NOT Load:**
- OAuth2 RFCs for non-OAuth components (e.g., shared types)
- Entire @docs/reference/ directory at once

### Documentation Requirements
- Write the detailed implementation plan to {{output_plan}}

### Scope Guards (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md for details)
**DO:**
- Break master plan into step-by-step checklists
- Create verification procedures
- Identify required context for implementation

**DO NOT:**
- Write code (only planning)
- Deviate from master plan scope
- Add features not in master plan

### Project Tracking Requirements (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md for ownership)

**Update @docs/context/current-phase.md:**
- [ ] Update "Current Phase" section with short paragraph summarizing the detailed plan that was created
- [ ] Update "Next Steps" with "Implementation ready to start"
- [ ] Update "Last Updated" timestamp
- [ ] Add links to detailed implementation plan

### Exit Criteria
- [ ] Detailed plan completed
      ✓ All master plan sections broken into steps
      ✓ Verification checklist defined
      ✓ All dependencies listed
- [ ] All project tracking updated
      ✓ current-phase.md updated
      ✓ "Last Updated" timestamp current
- [ ] Ready for next phase
      ✓ Detailed plan exists at {{output_plan}}
      ✓ No blockers for implementation
      ✓ feature-implementer has all required inputs

### Completion Signal (Output when done)
