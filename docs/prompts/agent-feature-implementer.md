## Task: Implement the detailed plan for "Shared Types Day 1: Foundation Types (Utilities, Flow, Token, HTTP)"

### Requirements
- Implement the checklist in "@docs/implementation-plans/feature-implementer/shared-types-day-1-foundation.md"
- Consult the component specification ("@docs/specs/auth-optics-shared-types-specification.md") for context and architectural direction
- Follow the technical specification exactly
- Use the OAuth2 RFCs and OIDC specs as the final authorities
- When finished with all implementation and verification tasks:
  * Create a new git branch
  * Commit the changes
  * Push the changes to origin
  * Create a GitHub PR for this branch

### Context Loading (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md)
**Always Load:**
- Detailed implementation plan: "@docs/implementation-plans/feature-implementer/shared-types-day-1-foundation.md"
- Component specification: "@docs/specs/auth-optics-shared-types-specification.md"
- @docs/context/current-phase.md

**DO NOT Load:**
- Deprecated flow specs unless explicitly required in plan
- Entire @docs/reference/ directory at once

### Scope Guards (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md for details)
**DO:**
- Implement exactly what's in the detailed plan
- Document implementation decisions in ROADMAP.md "Implementation Notes"
- Mark tasks complete as you finish them
- Update progress tracking

**DO NOT:**
- Implement features beyond the detailed plan (no scope creep)
- Refactor code outside the component scope
- Modify specification documents (flag discrepancies in pending-issues.md)
- Change architectural decisions (escalate to user)
- Skip verification steps

### Verification Requirements
- Run through the verification checklists in "@docs/implementation-plans/feature-implementer/shared-types-day-1-foundation.md" to ensure that you have implemented everything correctly

### Project Tracking Requirements (See @docs/context/agent-coordination.md for ownership)

**Update CLAUDE.md:**
- [ ] Update "Project Status" section (PRIMARY OWNER for this)

**Update ROADMAP.md:**
- [ ] Mark completed tasks as `[x]` in the relevant phase section (PRIMARY OWNER)
- [ ] Update component progress percentage in "Current Project Status" table (PRIMARY OWNER)
- [ ] Update "Overall Progress" bar if significant milestone reached (PRIMARY OWNER)
- [ ] Add any new blockers discovered to "Known Blockers" section (PRIMARY OWNER)
- [ ] Document key decisions in "Implementation Notes" section (PRIMARY OWNER)

**Update @docs/context/current-phase.md:**
- [ ] Update "Recently Completed" with what was just finished (PRIMARY OWNER)
- [ ] Update "Next Steps" with what should be done next (if blocked)
- [ ] Update "Last Updated" timestamp

**Update "@docs/implementation-plans/feature-implementer/shared-types-day-1-foundation.md":**
- [ ] Mark completed tasks as `[x]` in the relevant sections (PRIMARY OWNER)

**Update @docs/context/pending-issues.md (if applicable):**
- [ ] Add any issues discovered during implementation
- [ ] Categorize issues by priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Include file paths where issues were found

**Update @docs/context/integration-checklist.md (if applicable):**
- [ ] Mark integration tests as pending/complete/blocked
- [ ] Add any new integration points discovered
- [ ] Note any integration issues that need resolution

### Exit Criteria
- [ ] All implementation tasks complete
      ✓ All checklist items in detailed plan marked [x]
      ✓ Code written and committed to a new git branch
      ✓ GitHub PR created
- [ ] All verifications pass
      ✓ All verification scripts executed successfully
      ✓ Build succeeds without errors
      ✓ No critical issues blocking merge
- [ ] All project tracking updated
      ✓ ROADMAP.md tasks marked complete
      ✓ CLAUDE.md progress updated
      ✓ current-phase.md updated
      ✓ Detailed plan tasks marked [x]
- [ ] Ready for next phase
      ✓ PR exists
      ✓ Test and review agents have all required inputs
      ✓ No critical blockers
